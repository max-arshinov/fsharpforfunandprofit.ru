> In this series, we'll look at some of the ways we can use types as part of the design process.
> In particular, the thoughtful use of types can make a design more transparent and improve correctness at the same time.

> This series will be focused on the "micro level" of design.
> That is, working at the lowest level of individual types and functions.
> Higher level design approaches, and the associated decisions about using functional or object-oriented style, will be discussed in another series.

> Many of the suggestions are also feasible in C# or Java, but the lightweight nature of F# types means that it is much more likely that we will do this kind of refactoring.
